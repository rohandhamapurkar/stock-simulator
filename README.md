We have to create a single stock listed exchange simulator

It will work where there will be an exchange its assumed that the single stock which is listed has already its IPO done and only single stock can be bought or sold on the exchange.

The stocks Last Traded Price will be hardcoded.

Random buy and sell transactions will be generated based on the Last Traded Price, when ever the buy and sell transactions are matching it will update the Last Traded Price and will remove the transactions as well.

This will happen indefinitely until the exchange is stopped.
